This task demonstrates polymorphism using the Person interface, implemented by the Student and Employer classes.
Each class has a getInfo() method that returns relevant information: Student includes ID, name, surname, and age, while Employer includes name, surname, and age.

In the Main class, the user inputs data for a student and an employer, and the program outputs their information.
